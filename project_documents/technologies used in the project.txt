Building a Production-Ready RAG LLM Web App
We will implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, with a scalable backend (FastAPI), a conversational frontend (Streamlit), and a vector database (Pinecone) for embeddings. Our design will be stateless, ensuring uploaded files and conversations are temporary.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Frontend
Streamlit (for a ChatGPT-like interface)
Session Management (Handles ephemeral chat sessions)
Backend
FastAPI (for handling requests, processing documents)
Redis (for ephemeral session management)
Pinecone (for storing embeddings)
Deepseek (via Ollama/huggingface) (Should use vllm or ray-serve)
Ray Serve (for scalable inference)
PyPDF2 & python-docx (for document processing)
Infrastructure & Scalability
Docker (for containerization)
Kubernetes (AWS EKS) (for scalable deployment)
CI/CD (GitHub Actions) (for automated deployment)
